/// Trait used to define a single, startable service, with a relative socket path. For a more

/// [`declare_service_bundle`] macros that let you implement this trait far more concisely. For the
/// items emitted by service bundles, have a look at [`ReifiedService`], which embeds an executor
/// prefix and base context directory along with an abstract service implementation encoded by this
/// trait.
///
/// A service - in `suss` terminology - is a process that can be communicated with
/// through a [`std::os::unix::net::UnixStream`].
///
/// Services are run with a *base context path*, which acts as a runtime namespace and
/// allows multiple instances of collections of services without accidental interaction
/// between the groups - for instance, if you wanted a service to run once per user, you
/// could set the context directory as somewhere within $HOME or a per-user directory.
///
/// Services can also be provided an optional *executor prefix* - this is something that - in the
/// case of command execution to start a service, should be added to the start of all service
/// commands as the actual executable to run. This is useful for some cases:
/// * It may be useful to run anything with a prefix of /usr/bin/env in certain operating
///   environments like nixos
/// * It can be used to override implementations with a custom version of certain services
/// * It can be used to instrument services with some kind of notification or liveness system
///   outside of the one internally managed by this process
/// * Anything else you can think of, as long as it ends up delegating to something that actually
///   runs a valid service, or maybe fails if you want to conditionally prevent services from
///   functioning.
///
/// Each service has an associated *socket name*, which is a place in the *context base path*
/// that services put their receiver unix sockets. Services are checked for running-status by
/// if their associated socket files exist (and can be connected to) - i.e. they try to create a
/// `UnixStream` and if it fails, try to start the service.
///
/// Socket files, actually running the service, etc. are not handled by this trait. Instead, they
/// are handled by a [`ServerExt`], which takes care of things like cleaning up socket files
/// afterward automatically in [`Drop`]

/// A macro that aids in generating the common case of a service that has a command name and calls
/// out to a command.
///
/// This creates unit-type items that implement the [`Service`] trait, where the services are
/// started by standard [`std::process::Command`] execution - including correct executor prefix
/// implementation.
///
/// Wrapping [`std::os::unix::net::UnixStream`]s in higher-level abstractions can be specified in a
/// number of ways (in future, currently we only implement bare functions). These methods are
/// called *USP*s (**U**nix **S**tream **P**reprocessors), of which there is currently one (though
/// it should be able to implement any other with sufficient effort).
///
/// Using this macro goes something like the following:
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
/// use suss::declare_service;
///
/// declare_service! {
///     /// My wonderful service
///     pub WonderfulService = {
///         "some-wonderful-command" "--and" "--commandline" "args" @ "unix-socket-filename.sock"
///         as some_usp_method some_usp_method_specifications
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Services are just unit types in this case, and can have any visibility you like and
/// documentation or other things like `#[derive]` on them as desired.
///
/// The first part of the definition controls what command to run to execute the service, and the
/// socket it will serve on. The ephemeral liveness socket, as described in
/// [`ServerExt::start_and_run_server`], is passed through via an environment variable.
///
/// The literal after the @ is the name of the socket within the *base context directory* that
/// this service hosts itself upon. For example, if your base context directory is `/var/run`, and
/// the socket name for a service is `hello-service.sock`, then the service should receive
/// connections on `/var/run/hello-service.sock`.
///
/// Note that there is *no easy way* to pass in the base context directory to the command. This is
/// a concious decision - this library is designed for *services*, not just *subprocesses*, and
/// hence other programs should be able to find a service via some method derived from the
/// environment.
///
/// If nothing else, storing a context directory in an environment variable will do
/// the trick, but the point is that generally the base context directory should be defined by
/// environment, whether that be `XDG`, or a global fixed directory, or an environment variable, or
/// any combination of the above or some other environmental context.
///
/// This defines how a service is started and how to locate it. The stuff after the *as* provides
/// information on what to do once you've got a connection.
///
/// ### Methods
///
/// #### Raw
///
/// The `raw` method is essentially an arbitrary function that takes a
/// [`std::os::unix::net::UnixStream`] and produces (wrapped in a [`std::io::Result`]), a
/// higher-level abstraction over the stream that the rest of the world will have access to.
///
/// ```rust,compile_fail
///  ...rest-of-arg... as raw |name_of_raw_std_unix_socket_variable| -> Io<abstracted_and_wrapped_connection_type> {
///     Ok(some_wrapped_type)
///  }
