//! This is a library designed to ease the creation of a collection of singleton services namespaced to a single
//! base directory path with an arbitrary network of dependencies, starting services as needed,
//! using unix sockets as the communication mechanism.
//!
//! In the case that a service already exists, then this will communicate with the appropriate
//! socket, rather than start a new one.
//!
//! At the minute, to get started, you will need to define the [`Service`] trait to define client
//! an access point, along with a means of starting that service if it doesn't yet exist

/// Trait used to define a single, startable service, with a relative socket path.
///
/// A service - in `suss` terminology - is a process that can be communicated with
/// through a [`std::os::unix::net::UnixStream`].
///
/// Services are run with a *base context path*, which acts as a runtime namespace and
/// allows multiple instances of collections of services without accidental interaction
/// between the groups - for instance, if you wanted a service to run once per user, you
/// could set the context directory as somewhere within $HOME or a per-user directory.
///
/// Each service has an associated *socket name*, which is a place in the *context base path*
/// that all services put their receiver unix sockets. Services are checked for running-status by
/// if their associated socket files exist (and can be connected to) - i.e. they try to create a
/// `UnixStream` and if it fails, try to start the service.
///
/// Socket files, actually running the service, etc. are not handled by this trait. Instead, they
/// are handled by a [`ServerService`], which takes care of things like cleaning up socket files
/// afterward automatically in [`Drop`]
